    "If we cannot use the testing set, how can we check if a model is working well? We cannot use training nor testing set. For this reason we have something called Cross Validation. This is a simple idea. We just divide a training set into $k$ sets and train a model with $k-1$ set and get an error value with the remaining set. After we divided and used the last set to train, next thing we do is initialize a new model and train it with different combinations of $k-1$ sets and test with the one left. We do this process until there is no more combination of sets we haven't used to train model. Now we have $k$ different error values. We get the mean value of it and that will become our final performace score (or error value) of the model. Also by doing cross validation, we can check which subset of features produce high or low error and select the ones with low value.<br>\n",
